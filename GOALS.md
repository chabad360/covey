# Goals

This is a long list of goals (big and small) that I would like Covey to meet at some point.
I may attempt to organize this list, but be warned that it's not an official list of where Covey is headed, as things will be added and removed at (my) whim.
This is simply a place for me to put down those goals so future me has some pointers.

---

Here goes:

* [ ] Support HTTPS
* [ ] Become [CII compliant](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/4095#project_disabled_reminders)
* [ ] Fully manage Netdata (config and all)
* [ ] Add Netdata metrics for Covey
* [ ] Increase Covey's bus factor
* [ ] Do some performance profiling
* [ ] Get a code review (the codebase has quite a bit of cruft, maybe it can be periodic)
* [ ] Plugins.
* [ ] Add an SSH terminal to the node view
* [ ] Determine the best way to store node credentials
* [ ] Support SSO and friends (perhaps as a paid plugin)
* [ ] Proper cluster support
* [ ] Dark Theme
* [ ] CLI tool
* [ ] Postgres might not be the best way to store logs
* [ ] Vendor dependencies (maybe, I don't know how necessary it really is)
* [ ] Deal with properly logging
* [ ] Postgres might not be the best place to store keys
